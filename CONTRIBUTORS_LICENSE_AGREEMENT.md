# CodeWeaver Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

## Welcome to CodeWeaver!

Thanks for wanting to help make CodeWeaver better! Before you start, please read this. If anything’s unclear, [email Adam](mailto:adam@knit.li) or post in the [forum](https://github.com/knitli/code-weaver-mcp/discussions). (Right now, Adam *is* Knitli.)

## What You’re Agreeing To 📝

By submitting code, docs, or anything else to CodeWeaver, you agree:

- **You give Knitli Inc.[^1] permission** to use, change, and share[^2] your contributions—**forever**. That includes open source (CodeWeaver's choice of Apache 2.0 or MIT licenses), commercial, or any other context, and lets us license it to others.
- **Patent rights:** If your code is covered by any existing or future patents, you grant us and all CodeWeaver users a free license to use them, but only as far as your contribution goes.
- **You have the rights**: Your work is original, or you have permission (from your employer, etc). You’re not breaking anyone else’s rules or agreements.
- **You get credit:** We’ll list your name in docs and commit history and think you’re awesome.
- **Open stays open:** The open source version of CodeWeaver will always be available under an OSI-approved license (Apache 2.0 or MIT currently). Your contributions will always be open source, even if we include CodeWeaver in our commercial products.

## Standard Legal Stuff 👩‍⚖️

- **As is:** You’re contributing your work “as is” with no promises or guarantees. We’re not responsible for bugs, legal issues, or breakage.
- **You keep your rights:** You can use, share, license, or remix *your own* work anywhere, any way you want (yes, even wallpaper your room with it).
- **No Take-Backs:** Once you contribute, you can’t undo or take back your permission.

## For Companies 💼🏢

- If you’re contributing for your employer, make sure your company is on board and lets you submit.
- By contributing, you confirm you’re allowed to do so and your company agrees.
