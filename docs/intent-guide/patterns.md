## üìö Pattern Library Usage Tips

### **Start Broad, Then Narrow**
1. Begin with high-level understanding patterns
2. Use search patterns to locate specific areas of interest
3. Apply analysis patterns for deep insights

### **Combine Patterns Naturally**
- Mix intent types in single queries for comprehensive results
- Use context from previous queries to refine follow-up patterns
- Build progressive understanding through pattern chaining

### **Adapt Patterns to Your Context**
- Replace example paths with your actual directory structure
- Substitute technology names with your specific stack
- Modify scope and constraints based on your analysis needs

### **Iterate and Refine**
- Start with general patterns and refine based on results
- Use clarifying follow-up questions for ambiguous results
- Build pattern libraries specific to your codebase and domain
