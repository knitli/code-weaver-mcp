# Usage Patterns

Common patterns for using CodeWeaver with AI assistants. These examples work with Claude Desktop and other MCP clients.

## Search Patterns

### Finding Specific Code

**Functions and Methods:**
```
Find authentication functions in this project
Search for async functions that handle database operations
Show me React hooks that manage state
Locate API endpoint handlers
```

**Classes and Components:**
```
Find React components that use useEffect
Show Python classes that inherit from BaseModel
Search for Vue components with computed properties
Find TypeScript interfaces for API responses
```

**Patterns and Structures:**
```
Find all error handling patterns
Show me database schema definitions
Search for configuration files
Locate test files for the auth module
```

## Understanding Patterns

### Architecture Analysis

```
Explain how the authentication system works
How does error handling work in this codebase?
What's the data flow from frontend to backend?
How is configuration managed across the application?
```

### System Overview

```
What are the main components of this system?
How do the different modules interact?
What are the key architectural patterns used?
How is the application structured?
```

### Code Relationships

```
How do these components connect?
What are the dependencies for this module?
How does data flow through the system?
What are the integration points?
```

## Analysis Patterns

### Code Quality

```
What are the testing patterns in this codebase?
Find potential code quality issues
Analyze the error handling strategy
Review the logging and monitoring approach
```

### Security Analysis

```
Find potential security vulnerabilities
Analyze authentication and authorization patterns
Review input validation approaches
Check for common security anti-patterns
```

### Performance Analysis

```
Find performance bottlenecks in the API layer
Analyze database query patterns
Review caching strategies
Identify optimization opportunities
```

## Domain-Specific Patterns

### Frontend Development

```
Find React components that need optimization
Analyze state management patterns
Review accessibility implementations
Find responsive design patterns
```

### Backend Development

```
Analyze API design patterns
Review database integration approaches
Find middleware and interceptor usage
Analyze service layer architecture
```

### DevOps and Infrastructure

```
Find deployment configuration
Analyze monitoring and logging setup
Review CI/CD pipeline configuration
Find infrastructure as code patterns
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Cross-File Analysis

```
Trace the user registration flow across files
How does payment processing work end-to-end?
Follow the data validation pipeline
Trace error handling from frontend to backend
```

### Legacy Code Understanding

```
Explain this legacy authentication system
How does this old payment module work?
What are the dependencies of this legacy component?
How can we modernize this legacy pattern?
```

### Migration Planning

```
Find all uses of the old authentication library
Identify components that need React 18 migration
Find deprecated API usage patterns
Analyze coupling between legacy and new code
```

## Tips for Effective Queries

### Be Specific About Context

- Include file paths or directory names when relevant
- Specify technologies or frameworks when applicable
- Mention the domain or feature area you're exploring

### Use Natural Language

- Ask questions as you would to a colleague
- Describe what you want to understand or find
- Use domain terminology that makes sense in your context

### Combine Intent Types

- Start with understanding, then drill down to specific searches
- Use analysis patterns to identify areas for deeper exploration
- Combine architectural overview with specific implementation details

### Iterate and Refine

- Start broad, then get more specific
- Use follow-up questions to dive deeper
- Reference previous findings to build understanding
