# Development Workflows

**Practical examples of using CodeWeaver in your daily development work**

This guide demonstrates real-world development scenarios where CodeWeaver enhances productivity by providing intelligent code search and understanding through your AI assistant.

## Core Workflow Patterns

### 1. Project Exploration and Onboarding

**Scenario:** You're joining a new project or exploring an unfamiliar codebase.

#### Traditional Approach
```plaintext
1. Clone repository
2. Read README and documentation
3. Browse directory structure manually
4. Search for entry points and main files
5. Trace code execution paths manually
6. Time: 2-4 hours for basic understanding
```

#### CodeWeaver-Enhanced Approach
```plaintext
1. Clone repository and index with CodeWeaver
2. Ask natural language questions to understand architecture
3. Get instant context on components and relationships
4. Time: 30-60 minutes for comprehensive understanding
```

**Example Conversation:**
```plaintext
Developer: "I need to understand this codebase. Can you help me get oriented?"

AI + CodeWeaver:
"I'll index the codebase and then give you an overview. Let me start by understanding the project structure..."

[Indexes codebase]

"This appears to be a Node.js web application with:
- Express.js API server in src/server/
- React frontend in src/client/
- Authentication handled in src/auth/
- Database models in src/models/

Let me search for the main entry points..."

[Searches for application entry points]

"The main server starts in src/server/app.js, which sets up:
- Route handlers for API endpoints
- Authentication middleware
- Database connections
- Error handling

Would you like me to explain any specific component in detail?"
```

### 2. Feature Development

**Scenario:** Implementing a new feature that needs to integrate with existing code.

#### Example: Adding User Profile Management

**Step 1: Understanding Existing Patterns**

- Test data management
```

**Step 2: Coverage Analysis**
```plaintext

AI + CodeWeaver finds:
- Untested or lightly tested modules
- Complex functions without tests
- Edge cases not covered
- Error handling paths
```

## Language-Specific Workflows
