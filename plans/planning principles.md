## Architectural Strengths

### 1. Simplicity
- **Fewer Abstractions**: No factories, registries, service layers, middleware bridges
- **Clear Data Flow**: Graph structure shows exactly how data moves
- **Single Responsibility**: Each node does one thing well

### 2. Extensibility
- **Add Providers**: Implement interface, add to inference function
- **Add Nodes**: Create dataclass with run method
- **Add Flows**: Compose existing nodes in new ways
- **Add Intent Types**: Extend AnalyzeIntent logic

### 3. Performance
- **Natural Parallelization**: Independent operations run concurrently
- **Minimal Overhead**: Direct data flow without complex coordination
- **Efficient Resource Usage**: No unnecessary abstraction layers

### 4. Developer Experience
- **Self-Documenting**: Graph visualizations show system behavior
- **Easy Testing**: Each node is independently testable
- **Clear Debugging**: Graph execution shows exact failure points
- **Incremental Development**: Start simple, add complexity as needed

### 5. Maintainability
- **Explicit Dependencies**: Node return types define graph structure
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic models ensure data integrity
- **Version Control Friendly**: Changes are localized to specific nodes
- **Refactoring Safe**: Graph structure prevents breaking changes

## Dev Strategy

This architecture can be implemented incrementally:

1. **Phase 1**: Basic graph structure with simple intent analysis
2. **Phase 2**: Port existing functionality node by node
3. **Phase 3**: Add sophisticated intent analysis with NLP/LLM
4. **Phase 4**: Optimize with advanced parallelization and caching
5. **Phase 5**: Add conversational context and multi-turn queries


## Estimated Implementation Timeline

Development Timeline Breakdown

  Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (1-2 weeks)

  - Set up pydantic-graph integration and basic project structure
  - Define core types (CodeContext, ContentMatch, config models)
  - Create provider system foundation (abstract classes + inference function)
  - Implement basic nodes (AnalyzeIntent, End conditions)
  - Single working graph end-to-end (even if minimal)

  Phase 2: Provider Implementation (1 week)

  - Port existing VoyageAI and Qdrant implementations to new interfaces
  - Integrate pydantic-ai providers
  - File discovery and chunking (reuse existing ast-grep integration)

  Phase 3: Core Workflows (1-2 weeks)

  - Complete all basic nodes (EmbedQuery, SearchVectors, RerankResults)
  - Full indexing workflow (DiscoverFiles → ChunkFiles → EmbedChunks → StoreVectors)
  - Basic search workflow fully functional
  - FastMCP server integration with single `find_code` tool

  Phase 4: Advanced Features (1 week)

  - Hybrid search with parallel execution (ForkFlow, JoinResults)
  - Enhanced intent analysis logic
  - Error handling and edge cases
  - Basic caching layer

  Phase 5: Polish & Tools (1 week)

  - Complete CLI with cyclopts
  - Configuration system and environment integration
  - Testing, debugging, and performance tuning
  - Documentation and examples


  ## Random Thoughts/Considerations

  - We need some mechanism in the indexing for invalidating stale/changed results
    - something like difftastic maybe -- compare semantic reality with the state and somehow apply it as a filter -- if the current state doesn't reflect the core result within a certain level of precision it's filtered out
    - We need to consider mapping state changes to branches. This repo right now is a good example of the dangers -- I wiped the original codebase from this branch completely so we could build fresh and without polluting agent context, but a vector search would likely turn up the abandoned structure as a relevant result
    - invalidating vectors?
